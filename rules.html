        <br>1 - Be polite to other people. Offenses will not be tolerated.
        <br>2 - Do not steal or destroy other people's buildings
        <br>3 - Even with this rule 2, protect your buildings
        <br>4 - Do not leave holes on the surface. And try to replant the cut trees.
        <br>5 - Towers of width of 1 node will be destroyed and the author will suffer a punishment. So avoid it.
        <br>6 - Houses "floating" on water will also not be tolerated, except 
        <br>    in the shape of ships or something in the real world that floats on water.
        <br>7 - Also no farms floating on the water. Make an embankment to the bottom of the water body or an island.
        <br>8 - If you intend to do something floating in the air, zeppelins or blimps are allowed. No
        <br> castles or houses in the air. Airspace is used by flying machines, therefore it is controlled.
        <br>9 - You can start with a small construction, but one that is aesthetically beautiful. Ugly buildings
        <br>  will receive a sign notifying them of the need for improvement. If nothing is done, it will be demolished.
        <br>10 - Upon being noticed the use of hack, the user will be banned.
        <br><br><br>
        Follow the rules and have fun.</big></b>
